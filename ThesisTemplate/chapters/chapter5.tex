\chapter{Analysis and Results\label{cha:chapter5}}
In this section, results of primary and secondary research will be analyzed. Based on analysis,
hypotheses will be tested and results will be explained.

\section{Analysis and Findings For Hypothesis 1}
In primary research, all respondents of questionnaire agreed to the positive affects of resource
transfer on the success of spin-off. In Literature, however, some researchers believe that transferring of
resources could hinders the progress of spin-off, if not managed effectively. Some researchers have
argued that it deprived spin-off from independence and flexibility of performing operations which
negatively affected the spin-off innovation capabilities. However, majority of secondary research results are in
favor of hypothesis 1.

\section{Analysis and Findings For Hypothesis 2}
All respondents of questionnaire answered in favor of hypothesis 2. In addition, literature reviews
also supported the fact that previous industry experience and management skills help spin-offs to
outperform individual start-ups in early stages of development.

\section{Analysis and Findings For Hypothesis 3}
Two respondents (Imsys and Conatix) had previous networking relationships and believed that it
helped in innovation development. However, PTX tech GmbH, a Berlin based start-up, has no
previous connections with clients and its CEO believed that it had no affect on its innovation
capabilities. Results of secondary research are in favor of hypothesis 3. Since majority of results
support hypothesis 3, it appears that previous external relations with clients and providers help spin-offs to perform better than start-ups which do not have any networking with potential clients.


\section{Analysis and Findings For Hypothesis 4}

Both primary and secondary research support hypothesis 4. All respondents believed that lack of
motivation is a major factor affecting the progress of a firm. In literature, researchers also believe
that businesses with motivated and passionate employees flourish with bright colors.

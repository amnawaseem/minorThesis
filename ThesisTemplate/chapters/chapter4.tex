\chapter{Methodology\label{cha:chapter4}}
In this section, methodology used for testing hypotheses is discussed. Both primary and secondary
research methods had been used \cite{50}. Primary research was done using exploratory qualitative
interviews with help of questionnaires. Secondary research was conducted using qualitative analysis of related literature.

\section{Data Collection\label{sec:data-collection}}
Questionnaire and literature review were used to find the answers of research questions in this
paper. Questionnaire was developed using online resource \cite{51}. The
complete questionnaire is provided in  \nameref{appendix_graph}. Respondents to questionnaire were two start-
ups and one spin-off.

\section{Characteristics of Respondents of Questionnaire\label{sec:data}}
Some details on the businesses of respondents involved in questionnaire are provided in table \ref{table1}.

Data collected for testing each hypothesis is presented in the following sections

\section{Data For Hypothesis 1\label{sec:data1}}
Hypothesis 1 states that transfer of resources from parent company to spin-off improves its
innovation capabilities. Since start-ups are not developed from a parent company, lack of resources in the initial stage of development affects their innovation capabilities. Questions asked for testing this hypothesis were about affects of transferring resources
from parent companies to spin-offs. Figure \ref{fig4} shows the results of primary research conducted for Hypothesis 1.

Conatix CEO, David Lehrer, said the following about the resources they received
from parent company:
\\
\\
``\textbf{We received free and discounted use of office space from Humboldt University Berlin which
was valuable in the beginning, also servers and other old and used equipment from the
university}''.
\\

\section{Data For Hypothesis 2\label{sec:data2}}
This hypothesis states that previous industry experience and managerial skills help spin-offs to
innovate better than start-ups. Questions asked to respondents for testing this hypothesis were about
previous work experience and managerial skills before joining the current organizations. Figure \ref{fig5}  shows the results of questions asked for testing Hypothesis 2.
